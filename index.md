Hi, my name is Miray!
I study Public Policy at UC Berkeley's Goldman School, and I'm also doing research here.

More about me...
Trowing transcultural food fests is the best time!
I believe that serendipity is best created through movement. Thus, I enjoy long distance runnin, hiking with friends, and biking.
