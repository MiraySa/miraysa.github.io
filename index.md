Hi, my name is Miray!
I study Public Policy at UC Berkeley's Goldman School, and I'm also doing research here.

**About me:**

I believe in the power of community building through transcultural food fests!
Serendipity is best created through movement. Thus, I enjoy long distance runnin, hiking with friends, and biking. 

See you soon!
